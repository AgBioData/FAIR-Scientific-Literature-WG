# F.A.I.R. Scientific Literature Working Group - Database Finder Tool Documentation 
### Overview
This repository contains the auxillary datasets, and documentation generated during the development, evaluation, and analysis of the [AgBioData DatabaseFinder](https://www.agbiodata.org/databasefinder) tool. 


```MicroPublication_AgDataFinderToolDataset```
This file contains information on each of the included databases the finder tool can point to.  

1.Database Name
2. Database URL
3. Organisms/species are represented 
4. Brief summary about the database.
5. Contact URL or contact email address
6. Data submission information landing page URL
7. Data submission policy

For each of the remaining columns they represent specific data types. The values can be empty/null (no data), hosted (data is hosted by database) or direct submissions accepted (data can be contributed directly to the database). Definitions for each of the datatypes can be found at: https://www.agbiodata.org/db-finder-datatypes
